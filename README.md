## About Me

Passionate Machine Learning Engineer with 8+ years of experience spanning **Trading**, **Blockchain**, and **E-commerce**. I specialize in designing, developing, and deploying sophisticated AI solutions, with a strong focus on:

*   üöÄ **LLM-based Pipelines:** Expertise in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agentic workflows, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like LoRa/QLoRa, and distributed training for large models.
*   üõ†Ô∏è **MLOps & Scalability:** Proven ability to build robust, automated MLOps pipelines using tools like Kubeflow, MLFlow, Terraform, and Kubernetes on cloud platforms (AWS, GCP).
*   ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud Native:** Extensive hands-on experience with AWS (SageMaker, EKS, EC2, S3, CloudWatch, etc.) and GCP (Vertex AI, Pub/Sub, Dataflow) for building and deploying scalable ML systems.
*   üìä **Data Engineering & Analysis:** Skilled in data extraction, transformation, analysis, and visualization using big data tools like Spark, Kafka, Snowflake, and Airflow.
*   üìà **Domain Applications:** Track record of enhancing recommendation systems, developing crypto trading forecasting models, and building AI-driven chatbots in Web3/Blockchain domains.

I thrive on tackling complex challenges and building end-to-end, production-ready machine learning systems.
